# Off the Cloud

**Off the Cloud** is a command-line tool written in Rust for migrating mailboxes from one IMAP server to another. The tool uses a two-stage migration process consisting of the `pull` and `push` subcommands of the `imap` command to securely transfer mailbox data, maintaining folder structure and message integrity. 

This tool is ideal for migrating email between servers or backing up email to a local storage structure.

## Features

- [x] **Two-Stage Migration**: Migrate mailboxes in two steps with `pull` (download) and `push` (upload) commands.
- [x] **Configurable Storage**: Save messages to a specified directory with user-specific folders and a mirrored IMAP folder structure.
- [x] **File-Based Storage**: Emails are saved as individual files in `.eml` format, e.g., `000001.eml`.
- [x] **Incremental Pulling**: Only new messages are downloaded in repeated `pull` actions.
- [x] **Customizable IMAP Folder Structure**: Set custom folder name mappings for localization and modify the delimiter for folder hierarchy.

## Upcoming Features
- [ ] **Calendar Backups**: CalDAV, *.ical support.
- [ ] **WebDAV transfers**: WebDAV support.

## Installation

To install `Off the Cloud`, you will need Rust installed. Once Rust is set up, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DirectX/off-the-cloud.git
cd off-the-cloud
cargo install --path ./
```

Copy example configuration and change settings to necessary for source and target server configs. Optional values are commented.

```
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
cp .example.env .env
```

## Usage

Run `off-the-cloud --help` to see general usage instructions.

### IMAP Migration Workflow

1. **Pull**: Download emails from the source IMAP server.
2. **Push**: Upload emails to the target IMAP server.

### Example Workflow

1. **Configure** `config.yaml` to specify IMAP server settings for the `pull` and `push` stages. See [Configuration](#configuration).
2. **Pull** emails from the source server:

   ```bash
   off-the-cloud imap pull --email user@example.com --password <PASSWORD> --out-dir messages
   ```

3. **Push** emails to the destination server:

   ```bash
   off-the-cloud imap push --email new_user@example.com --password <PASSWORD> --in-dir messages
   ```

### CLI Commands

The application has the following command structure:

```text
off-the-cloud <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]
```

#### `imap pull`

Downloads messages from the source IMAP server and stores them locally.

**Options:**
- `--email`: Email address for the source account.
- `--password`: Password for the source account.
- `--out-dir`: Output directory for stored messages (default: `messages`).
- `--export-mbox`: Optionally export messages in Mbox format for further importing manually. No `*.eml` files storing in this mode and `imap push` wouldn't work after.
- `--max-file-size`: File size limit for Mbox exports (only if `--export-mbox` is set).

#### `imap push`

**Options:**
- `--email`: Email address for the destination account.
- `--password`: Password for the destination account.
- `--in-dir`: Input directory containing downloaded messages (default: `messages`).

Uploads messages to the destination IMAP server.

> [!WARNING]
> Call `imap push` only once. Repetitive call of `imap push` command will cause doubling of messages. Be careful!

## Configuration

**Off the Cloud** uses a configuration file `config.yaml` to specify IMAP server details, custom folder delimiters, and folder name mappings. Example:

```yaml
imap:
  pull:
    server: imap.gmail.com
    port: 993
  push:
    server: imap.example.com
    port: 993
    folder_delimiter: /
    folder_name_mappings:
      "Envoy√©s": "Sent"
      "Corbeille": "Trash"
      "Pourriel": "Junk"
```

### Configuration Options

- **server**: IMAP server address.
- **port**: Port for IMAP connections (e.g., 993 for SSL).
- **folder_delimiter**: Character for folder hierarchy (e.g., `.` or `/`).
- **folder_name_mappings**: Mappings for IMAP folder names, allowing localized folder names to be translated (e.g., French to English).
